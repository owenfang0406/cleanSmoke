# ClearSmoke Introduction
<a id="intro"></a>

ClearSmoke is a photographer service provider platform where users can come here to register as a photographer to seek potential clients and vice versa. Furthermore, users can share posts with pics they took here as a social media and users registered as a photographer will be shown a badge when they upload posts so that other users can identify them at the very first glance. When the users are attracted by the post fed by photographers, users can reach out other users or photographers via chatroom and eventually make an appointment for photography through this website.
